# Introduction {#intro}

This guide is an attempt to streamline and demystify the data analysis process. \
By no mean this is an ultimate guide, or I am a great source of knowledge, or I claim myself as a statistician/data analyst/econometrician (or any fancy name we have now), but I am a strong proponent of learning by teaching. Hence, this is more like a learning experience for both you and me.

Since the beginning of the century, we have been bombarded with amazing advancements and inventions, especially in the field of statistics, information technology, and computer science. However, I believe the downside of this introduction is that we use **big** and **trendy** words too often (i.e., big data, machine learning, deep learning). \
It's all fun and exciting when I learned these new tools. But I have to admit that I hardly retain any of these new inventions.However, writing down from the beginning till the end of a data analysis process is the solution that I came up with. Accordingly, let's dive right in.  

The more you practice, more line of codes that you write, more function that you memorize, I think the more you will like this journey.  

Information in this book are from various sources, but the skeleton is based on several courses that I have taken formally. I'd like to give professors credit accordingly.  

Course | Professor

Data Analysis I | Erin M. Schliep
