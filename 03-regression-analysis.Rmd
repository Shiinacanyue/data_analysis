# Regression Analysis
## Linear Regression
### Ordinary Least Squares
The most fundamental model in statistics or econometric is a OLS linear regression. 

**Hierarchy of OLS Assumptions**

|Identification Data Description | Unbiasedness Consistency | Gauss-Markov(BLUE) Asymptotic Inference (z and Chi-squared) | Classical LM (BUE) Small-sample Inference (t and F)|
|--- | --- | --- | ---|
|Variation in X | Variation in X | Variation in X | Variation in X|
|     | Random Sampling | Random Sampling  | Random Sampling |
|     | Linearity in Parameters | Linearity in Parameters | Linearity in Parameters|
|     | Zero Conditional Mean | Zero Conditional Mean | Zero Conditional Mean|
|     |                | Homoskedasticity | Homoskedasticity|
|     |           |        | Normality of Errors|
