 * What is deep learning?
Input to output via layers of representation

 * What are layers?
A layer is a geometric transformation function on the data that goes through it Weights determine the data transformation behavior of a layer  

<br>
Learning Representation  

 * Transforming input data into useful representation  
 
<br>

The "deep" in deep learning  

 * multiple layers 
 * Other possibly more appropriate names for the field:
    + Layered representations learning 
    + Hierarchical representations learning 
    + Chained geometric transformation learning

### Tensor Flow and R
TensorFlow APIs  

 * Keras API  
 * Estimator API  
 * Core API  

<br>

#### R packages 
TensorFlow APIs 
 * keras: Interface for neural networks, with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. 
 * tfestimators: Implementations of common model types such as regressors and classifiers.  
 * tensorflow: Low *level interface to the TensorFlow computational graph. 
 * tfdatasets: Scalable input pipelines for TensorFlow models.

Supporting Tools 
 * tfruns : Track , visualize, and manage TensorFlow training runs and experiments 
 * tfdeploy : Tools designed to make exporting and serving TensorFlow models straightforward. 
 * cloudml : R interface to Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine.  

R interface to Keras  

 * Step by step example  
 * [Keras layers]  
 * [Compiling models]  
 * [Losses, Optimizers, and Metrics] 
 * More examples  

<br>

#### Keras layers  
65 layers available  

 * Dense layers: classic "fully connected" neural network layers  
 * Convolutional layers: "Filters for learning local patterns in data  
 * Recurrent layers: Layers that maintain state based on on previously seen   data 
 * Embedding layers: Vectorization of text that reflects semantic relationships between words  


### Compiling models
Model compilation prepares the model for training by:  
1. Converting the layers into a TensorFlow graph  
2. Applying the specified loss function and optimizer  
3. Arranging for the collection of metrics during training  

### Losses, Optimizers, and Metrics
All available at Keras for R [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/keras.pdf)
