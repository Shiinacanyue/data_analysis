# Panel Data Methods

-   Proposed by [@hsiao2011], using dependence among cross-sectional units to create counterfactual for the treated unit.

-    If the pre-treatment period observations are less than the number of control units, we can't use this method because of not enough degrees of freedom

```{r}
# install.packages("pampe")
library('pampe')

# dataset form the original paper 
data(growth)
head(growth)
colnames(growth)
rownames(growth)
```

Hong Kong is the treated unit, while the other 24 donors are control units

```{r}
hcw <-
    pampe(
        time.pretr = 1:18,
        time.tr = 19:44,
        treated = "HongKong",
        controls = c(
            'China',
            'Indonesia',
            'Japan',
            'Korea',
            'Malaysia',
            'Philippines',
            'Singapore',
            'Taiwan',
            'UnitedStates',
            'Thailand'
        ),
        data = growth
    )
