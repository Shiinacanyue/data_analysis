# Interrupted Time Series

-   Regression Discontinuity in Time

-   Control for

    -   Seasonable trends

    -   Concurrent events

-   Pros [@Penfold_2013]

    -   control for long-term trends

-   Cons

    -   Min of 8 data points before and 8 after an intervention

    -   Multiple events hard to distinguish

Notes:

-   For subgroup analysis (heterogeneity in effect size), see [@harper2017]

```{r}
# data preparation
set.seed(1)
CaseID = rep(1:100, 6)

# intervention
Intervention = c(rep(0, 300), rep(1, 300))
Outcome_Variable = c(rnorm(300), abs(rnorm(300) * 4))

mydata = cbind(CaseID, Intervention, Outcome_Variable)

mydata = as.data.frame(mydata)

#construct a simple OLS model
model = lm(Outcome_Variable ~ Intervention, data = mydata)
summary(model) # there is a signficant effect 
```
