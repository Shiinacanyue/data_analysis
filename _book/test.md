## Intro

[@athey2019machine] ML for economists

-   **Machine Learning in Economics**:

    -   ML techniques can be effective, but they often require adaptation to address specific economics problems, like the causal nature of estimands or the endogeneity of variables.

    -   ML can benefit from insights developed in traditional statistics and econometrics.

    -   There are recent advances in adapting ML for specific economic research questions, focusing on causality.

## **Economists' Toolkit**:

Empirical economist's toolkit should include:

-   Nonparametric regression

-   Supervised learning for classification and regression

-   Unsupervised learning, clustering, and density estimation

-   Estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects and optimal policies

-   ML approaches to experimental design

-   Matrix completion applications in panel data models and consumer choice

-   Analysis of text data.

## Comparison: Econometrics vs Machine Learning


| **Aspect** | **Econometrics** | **Machine Learning** |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Estimation of parameters, emphasizing the quality of the estimators. | Development of algorithms mainly for prediction and classification purposes. |
| **Examples of Goal** | Estimation of a parameter of a statistical model. | Predict outcomes based on features or classify units. |
