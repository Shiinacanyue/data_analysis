$$
Y_i =
\begin{cases}
Y_{1i} & T=1 \\
Y_{0i} & T=0
\end{cases}
$$

$Y_i = Y_{0i}+ (Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}) T$

where $(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i})$ is causal

$$
\begin{aligned}
& E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=0] \\
= &E[Y_{1i} |T_i =1] - E[Y_{0i} |T=0] \\
=& E[Y_{1i} | T_i = 1] - E[Y_{0i} |T=1] + E[Y_{0i} |T=1]- E[Y_{0i} |T=0]
\end{aligned}
$$

where

-   $ATET = E[Y_{1i} | T_i = 1] - E[Y_{0i} |T=1]$

<!-- -->

-   $\text{selection bias} = E[Y_{0i} |T=1]- E[Y_{0i} |T=0]$

Potential outcomes with random assignment

$$
E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=0]
$$

with random assignment we have $E[Y_i |T=0] = E[Y_i |T=1]$ if the outcome is not correlated with the treatment assignment.

Randomization ensure that nay confounding factors $C$ are orthogonal to the treatment, as is the underlying propensity for outcome $Y$

If variation in $X$ is random, we don't need to worry about specifying the appropriate model with appropriate assumption or measuring and controlling for all relevant determinants, etc.

then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{what we observe} &= E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=0] \\
ATET &= E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=1] && \text{random assignment} \\
ATE &= E[Y_{1i} ] - E[Y_{0i}]
\end{aligned}
$$

Under random assignment, ATET = ATE

Selection on observable

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{what we observe} &= E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=0] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

if you add the $X$'s that determine that treatment assignment, then $E[Y_i |T=0,X]= E[Y_i |T=1,X]$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{what we observe} &= E[Y_i |T_i = 1] - E[Y_i |T=0] \\
ATET &= E[Y_i |T_i = 1,X] - E[Y_i |T_i = 1,X]
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming $0 < P(T,X) <1 \forall X$

We don't always believe selection of observables. But it does formalize other methods that we use. (e.g., running variable under RDD).

Difficulties with random assignment:

1.  Expensive
2.  Infeasible
3.  Unethical
4.  Desirability bias
5.  Attrition
6.  Non-compliance

Second-best solution: find "natural experiments", or as-good-as-random variation in the treatment.

3 approaches:

1.  Regression Discontinuity Design
2.  Instrumental Variables
3.  Difference-in-Difference

If you want to estimate the effect of X on Y, you have to have as-good-as-random variation in X

If you don't have exogenous variation inn X, then the only way to determine the causal effect of X on anything is to add additional info (i..e, structure) to the problem, and hope you're right (with evidence)
