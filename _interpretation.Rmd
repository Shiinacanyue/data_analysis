## PEA vs. APE

|             | PEA                                                                                           | APE                                                               |

| Term        | Partial effect at the average                                                                 | Average partial effect                                            |
| Definition  | The effect of some $X$'s on $Y$ for a (hypothetical) case with sample averages for all $X$'s  | The effect of $X$ on $Y$ averaged across the sample               |
| Calculation | Set all $X$'s at their sample mean, get the slope of $Y$ with respect to your $X$ of interest | Calculate the partial effect for all cases, and take the average. |

For OLS with independent variables in a linear functional form, $APE = PEA$. (i.e., OLS assumes that partial effect of X dose not vary across $X$'s)

Hence, $PEA \neq APE$ whenever you have departure from the standard OLS (e.g., interaction, polynomial, logit, probit, etc.)
