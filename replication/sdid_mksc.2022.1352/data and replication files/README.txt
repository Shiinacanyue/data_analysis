We include 4 files:

1. data_file_for_replication_small.csv - Because the data is proprietary, this file 

contains a disguised random sample of 5% of the companies from the monthly full dataset 

used in the paper.

2. SDiD.do - This file contains the code to produce the main results of the SDiD section

of the paper. This includes the first two columns of Table 5, and generation of the 

coefficients for Figure 2 (analyses generated by estimating Equations 2 and 3).

3. SynthDiD-fun.R - a file containing functions that generate coefficients and SE as 

described in the SynthDid section.

4. SynthDiD.R - a file that runs the main specification in the SynthDiD section, that 

produced Figure 3 and columns 3 and 4 of Table 5. The output text file reports point

estimates and standard errors for periods before adoption (l), after adoption (f), 

and cumulative effects (c).


Note: Since the data file contains a random 5% sample, the point estimates 

differ from those reported in the paper and the standard errors are greater, 

but the main direction of the findings overall hold. Additionally, the pre-adoption

matching in the SynthDiD is noisier than in the paper given the small number of 

observations used, but the results are directionally similar.

The data file contains 2,090 Retailer-Channel X Month observations. They contain data of

randomly selected 105 retailers that represent 107 retailer-channels.
