New workflow

1.  Data cleaning
2.  Estimation
3.  Inference with data cleaning-adjusted confidence intervals.

From this paper, one can still achieve $\sqrt{n}$ consistency, Gaussian approximation, semi-parametric efficiency with an assumption of low-rank true covariates.

Data corruption

1.  Old
    1.  Missing values

    2.  Measurement error
2.  New
    1.  Differential privacy

    2.  Discretization

Solutions to data corruptions

-   Semi-parametric statistics

-   PCA for large factors models

-   Treatment effects with corrupted data

    -   Multiple imputation

    -   Synthetic control

-   Error-in-variables regression

    -   Auxiliary info: repeated measurement, instrument, negative control

    -   Lasso and Dantzig: known covariance of measurement error

    -   Principal component regression

Differential privacy

Goals:

-   Want to learn about the the population

-   Without compromising individual data.

Solutions:

1.  De-identification (anonymization): removes identifiying info from the dataset (subject to database-linkage attacks)
2.  Only allow aggregate queries (e.g., average) (good only when groups are big enough)
3.  Differential privacy:
    1.  Adding noise to the data (e.g., Laplace mechanism)

Benefits of differential privacy

1.  Assume all info is identifying info (not subject to database-linkage)
2.  Use auxiliary info (not subject to database-linkage)

Definition

-   "An algorithm is said to be differentially private if by looking at the output, one cannot tell whether any individual's data was included in the original dataset or not" (definition by [SEAS group](https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy))
