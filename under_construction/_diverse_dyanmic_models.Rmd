Diverse Dynamic Models

Model 0: linear regression (static, no dynamics)

$$
y_t = \beta x_t + \epsilon_t
$$

where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$\
Model 1: Dynamics + Regression

$$
y_t = \lambda y_{t-1} + \beta x_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

where

-   $\lambda$ is the carryover effect

-   $\beta$ = ad effectiveness

Model 2: Model 1 + Serial Correlation

$$
y_t  = \lambda y_{t-1} + \beta x_t + \epsilon_t \\
\epsilon_t = \rho \epsilon_{t-1} + \nu_t, \nu_t \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
$$

Model 3: Time-varying effectiveness

$$
y_t  = \lambda y_{t-1} + \beta_t x_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon) \\
\beta_t = \beta_{t-1} + \nu_t, \nu_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\nu)
$$

Model 4: Slow variation in effectiveness

$$
y_t  = \lambda y_{t-1} + \beta_t x_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon) \\
\nabla^2 \beta_t = \nu_t, \nu_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\nu)
$$

Second order change of $\beta$ is slow

Every Linear dynamic model can be cast in a state space form

$$
\alpha_t = T_t \alpha_{t-1} + d_t + \nu_t
$$

Model 5: Switching dynamics

Dim(observed Y) \< Dim (Dynamics)

Salient features

-   Awareness measure noisy $A_t = G_t + \epsilon_t$ (observed awareness)

-   Goodwill dynamics observed indirectly via awareness $dG/dt = \beta(t) u -\delta G$ (goodwill dyanmics

-   Multiple dynamics (coupled) $d\beta/dt = -(c + wu(t)) \beta$ if $u \neq 0$ wear out dynamics

    -   $d\beta/dt = -c \beta + \delta (1- \beta)$ if $u = 0$ restoration dynamics

Partially observed system

Model 6: Hierarchy of Effect

Dim (observed Y) \> Dim (dynamics)\
Different soft metrics to measure three factors

-   Cognition, affect, experience

-   Three factors evolve in time (dynamics)

-   Advertising affects (C, A, E) which, in turn, affect sales

    -   GRPs to C to A to E to sales

    -   All other possible patterns

Model 7: Dim (observed Y) = dim(dynamics)

-   Var-x models

-   Vector cousin of model 1

    -   N Y-variables

    -   k X-variables in each Y_i equation

    -   p lagged Y-terms include dynamics

Model 8: ARMAX(p,q,k)

-   Vector cousin of Model 2

-   On top of model 7, dynamics in error terms were added

    -   q lagged error-term include additional dynamics

Model 9: Nonlinear dynamics

-   Bass (1969) model: $dS/dt = (p + qS)(M-S)$

-   Sethi (1983) model: $dS/dt = \beta u \sqrt{M-S} - \delta S$

-   Sorger (1989) model:

    -   Two player share game

    -   Logical consistency

-   Building brand awareness in dynamic oligopoly markets (MS 2008)

Model 10: Hidden Markov Model

$$
y_t  = \lambda_s y_{t-1} + \beta_s x_t + \epsilon_t, \epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_s) \\
$$
