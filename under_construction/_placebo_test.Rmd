# Placebo Test

-   A form auxiliary analysis where treatment should not have an effect on the dependent variable

-   This is an indirect ways of assessing the **unconfoundedness assumption**

-   Presence of a significant effect can indicate problems with the study design

-   Also known as

    -   balance test

    -   falsification test

    -   refutability test

    -   tests for known effects

    -   test of unconfoundedness

    -   tests with negative controls

2 methods:

1.  Estimate the causal effect of a treatment that is already understood to have no impact.

2.  Estimate the causal effect of a treatment on variables that are known to be unaffected by it.

Both strategies depend on evaluating the null hypothesis that the average causal effect equals zero
