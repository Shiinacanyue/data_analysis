# Standard Error Corrections

-   Clustered Standard Errors

    -   Use clustered standard errors to correct for serial correlation within the group (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan, 2004).

-   Problematic if few clusters (5 - 30).

    -   Cluster bootstrap methods perform well in cases with as few as six clusters [@cameron2008bootstrap]. This can also applied to clusters of years (i.e., if you have too few years).

-   When one cluster is fully nested within another, it's best to cluster at the higher level for more conservative standard errors [@cameron2011robust ].
